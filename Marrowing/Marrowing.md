Each spell specifies a base stat it is cast with.

Your max dice pool size is the dice pool of the spells base stat + your marrow dice pool

You can decide how many dice you use for the spell check, up to the max size of the dice pool.

You are considered skilled in the spell check if you are skilled in the marrow talent.

Any successes of the dice pool apply to the spell effect.

The added sum of all fails of the dice pool are suffered as direct damage to hit points.
