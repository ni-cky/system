## A Story starts
The world of Talebones ended centuries ago. What remains are stories, living stories that are being told by each and every one of us...

Talebones is a dark fantasy table top and Pen & Paper roleyplaying game focused on the **power of a good narrative**. The world is inspired by folktales, fairy tales and myths from all around the world that enthrall the characters of the players and do not intend to let go of them. Talebones is both **whimsical and deadly, scary and full of wonder, humorous and existental**.

Streamlined rules and mechanical benefits for self-expression allow for a roleplaying focused experience and combine that with short, fast and epic fight scenes, inspired by the game "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice" by fromsoftware.

The Kickstarter will fund the production of Talebones' core rulebook and several marvelous extras.

## Tales in our Bones
In the wake of the end many things changed in the world. Civilization fell and fractured, only leaving spread out villages and towns fighting for their survival on a daily basis.

**Explore the remnants of ancient society** as it gets taken over by the unknowable dangers responsible for the end still roaming the world. Ancient structures, ancient secrets, and ancient mistakes are yours to discover.

**Travel from town to town** through the wilderness in between, facing the grave dangers common Folk do not dare to even consider, and convince each new town you arrive in that it is worth it to welcome and support you.

**Release the magic in your own bones** by drawing on the Marrow that is released as you break them, disfiguring yourself in the middle of tense scenes, and wielding powerful incantations to shape your story to your liking.

**Master your weapons** and slowly become one of the greatest fighters in the world, dueling anyone that dares to stand in your way. Learn the special properties of each weapon and ways to use them that go beyond just striking with them.

**Fight epic multi-phase battles** against the strong and powerful in the world and grow each time you come out of a confrontation victorious. Do not become the villain of your own story though.

**Do not stop telling your story** just because you die. Come back alive by fracturing one of your Talebones, but pay the price for it each time. Slowly your character's backstory seeps into the cultural consciousness and becomes folktale. But the fewest folktales report events favourably.

**Incluce any story you see fit** into this setting that thrives on tropes and themes. Any narrative can find its place here as the larger movements of the world are that of a dark fantasy horror story.

**Create your character freely** only bound by the most basic restrictions necessary to function as a playable character. Work with your game master to customize the Folk you are playing by giving them a unique appearance, a unique background and unique talents.

**Share your story** and gain mechanical benefits from it, be it regaining more hit points during a rest, gain advantages during challenges, or work with your game master to turn the world against you using your talebones.

## Rules
Talebones works with our own dice system, lovingly called **(Dice) Goblin System**.

**Success based.** Similar to other Pool based systems like the Storyteller system (i.e. Vampire: The Masquarade etc.) any action determines a number of successes to judge how succesful the result is.

**All the d20s.** The only type of dice needed for the Goblin system are 20-sided dice. In one roll you sometimes roll up to 9 of them and per die you can achieve one success.

**Character Range.** Compared to other systems which use d6s or d10s, a d20 allows the Goblin system to represent a wider range of skill levels and advantages in a single roll.

**Shifting difficulty.** The benchmark a die needs to hit to be a success shifts with every roll, using a streamlined system to allow for quick readability and play.
