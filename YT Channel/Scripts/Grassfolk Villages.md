"Grassfolk transmit diseases. Grassfolk are erratic. Grassfolk are mysterious. The smallest of the Folk have many unanswered questions about them. Partly due to their natural inclination towards Marrowing, in other parts due to their natural stealthiness. Folk can be so tiny, that they can't be seen with the common eyesight. So you do not get sick if you clean yourself because you get rid of Grassfolk covering your skin, or at least so is the assumption. Due to their often brittle bones, Grassfolk learn to deal with Marrow right from the start. The many small accidents in a young Grassfolks life do not quite lead to catastrophes, but any Grassfolk should learn to control their Marrow.

Usually it is nearly impossible to suprise a Grassfolk village. Some are protected by early Marrowing alarms or by repelling incantations. But even without the towns are usually hard to find, as many Grassfolk tend to live underground. Due to their size they do not need to move as much earth as larger Folk to create a home. Due to these protections and strict size limits it is often of purely practical reasoning that larger Folk do not enter or stay. But do not misunderstand, the Grassfolk usually are generally mistrusting of the brutal others that trampel their gardens on the regular.

Many a Grassfolk are great artisans or Marrow witches. Their natural skills in Marrowing help them to have better eyes, a more steady hand, or other advantages compared to taller craftsmen. Their incantations tend to be of much higher complexity, especially to circumvent the need for larger bones to keep them active. Grassfolk are curious and interested to learn new things. If they have an opportunity to explore the wilderness \*safely\*, few will flat out ignore it. And who knows, maybe the others are not as bad as the rest."
