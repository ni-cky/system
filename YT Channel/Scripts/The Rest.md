_“In these parts, there are the villages, and there’s ‘the rest’. The villages are communities of Grassfolk, Folk, and Treefolk respectively. Grassfolk a group of people of which the tallest are barely as tall as a folk child, while Treefolk children, tower most but the tallest folk adults. Beyond these superficial groupings, no one folk is unified in appearance or form. The world seems to have made a cruel joke out of making each and every person unique in appearance, temper, and form._

_‘The rest’ is not a good place to be. The wilds between villages are untamed. So for centuries, haunted by monsters, beasts, and ‘the rest’, only the most fool hearty take it upon themselves to travel between communes. And fools die a quick death.”_
