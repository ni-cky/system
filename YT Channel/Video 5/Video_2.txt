"Usually it is nearly impossible to suprise a Grassfolk village. Some are protected by early Marrowing alarms or by repelling incantations. But even without the towns are usually hard to find, as many Grassfolk tend to live underground. Due to their size they do not need to move as much earth as larger Folk to create a home. Due to these protections and strict size limits it is often of purely practical reasoning that larger Folk do not enter or stay. But do not misunderstand, the Grassfolk usually are generally mistrusting of the brutal others that trampel their gardens on the regular."
