"Many a Grassfolk are great artisans or Marrow witches. Their natural skills in Marrowing help them to have better eyes, a more steady hand, or other advantages compared to taller craftsmen. Their incantations tend to be of much higher complexity, especially to circumvent the need for larger bones to keep them active. Grassfolk are curious and interested to learn new things. If they have an opportunity to explore the wilderness \*safely\*, few will flat out ignore it. And who knows, maybe the others are not as bad as the rest."
