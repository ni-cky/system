"Grassfolk transmit diseases. Grassfolk are erratic. Grassfolk are mysterious. The smallest of the Folk have many unanswered questions about them. Partly due to their natural inclination towards Marrowing, in other parts due to their natural stealthiness. Folk can be so tiny, that they can't be seen with the common eyesight. So you do not get sick if you clean yourself because you get rid of Grassfolk covering your skin, or at least so is the assumption. Due to their often brittle bones, Grassfolk learn to deal with Marrow right from the start. The many small accidents in a young Grassfolks life do not quite lead to catastrophes, but any Grassfolk should learn to control their Marrow."
