"Once upon a time there were fewer others. Legends tell of a world, filled with groups of people. Some called them species, some: races. Humans, elves, gnomes and so many more. But those are foreign concepts to any Folk of our time. Something... changed. Something in the water, something in the air. And most certainly something in our bones. The world has changed and we with it. Now everyone is unique. Perhaps there are still people with long ears and an innate connection to nature, maybe there are stout, tunnel digging, bearded guys. But they are just Folk. Everyone is just.... Folk. Most of the times these appearances and abilities are only partially inherited, so even within one family it tends to be difficult to recognize patterns."
