"Of course villages *need* travellers. They need merchants to trade produce and unique objects. They need messengers to tell them news about other places. They need adventurers to deal with 'the rest'. Noone is happy about it, but these kinds of people *are* necessary. But necessary does not mean liked. Necessary does not mean welcome. Travellers do get a place to sleep regularly. They are welcome, but a kind of welcome that is rarely conected to openess. Those who travel through the wilds have to be treated carefully. They are able to deal with most what 'the rest' can throw at them. A normale Folk cannot match such a feat. But they are still from outside. They are unknown, not of our community. They are 'the others'."
