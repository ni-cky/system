"One might think this obvious showcase of randomness would bring everyone together. Create one Folk, unified even if everyone looks different. Or rather because of it. But Folk are not that. What is lacking in visual groupings is replaced by birthplace. Families and communities hold even stronger together in the face of an unknowable 'Other' outside of the village borders. Anyone stepping into these tightly knit groups, is met with distrust and sometimes open hostility. Afterall who are you to have left your home? Afterall is there a reason why you don't stay where you are from? Travelling comes with a large stigma. A fate to be always outside the places you visit, always be at the edge of society."
