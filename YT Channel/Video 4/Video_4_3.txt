"Those lucky getting to know treefolk closer, often report of people with empathy and a natural understanding of their surroundings. Their large bones allow them to have a natural connection to anything abnormal roaming the wilds and some superstitions imply that that might be due to a common origin in the past. A Treefolk leaving their village is unique, but if they do, they quickly find a new family, a new group to stick to and face whatever new curiosities the wilderness, the others and the rest bring."
