"Treefolk are the only group that sometimes decides to live a life of nomads. Travelling through the wilderness in larger groups and only errecting temporary settlements for limited times. These settlements are basic and simple. Usually a collection of basic huts or tents of enormous size, surrounding a central square for eating and sharing community. Outsiders are welcome, but just temporarily. A Treefolk village is a highly tight knit community and usually it is impossible to join one as a foreigner. The villages might appear to have no real way to protect themselves from the "rest", but usually that isn't an issue, as the fewest try to actively attack a group of very large, very strong people."
