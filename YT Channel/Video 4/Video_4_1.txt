"Some Folk are tall. Some Folk are huge. Few Folk are gargantuan in size. But all of them are called Treefolk. Legends tell of Treefolk as large as mountain ranges. But the average treefolk is around two to three times the size of regular Folk. Large enough to withstand many perils, but not so large that they become distant in mood. Rather the opposite is the general behaviour of them. Due to their size, so many of the dangers in the wilderness are more afraid of Treefolk, than Treefolk are of them. And even the daring parts of "the rest" are at times at a loss of how to deal with these Folk. This reduced danger in their life leads to a group of people open and friendly to most others. Their bones are massive in size and sturdy to a fault. Due to that, their Marrow is usually the most slow to react, and struggles to reliably produce incantations. If a Treefolk trains themselves to it though, the raw power possible to pull from them rivals all other sources of Marrowing."
