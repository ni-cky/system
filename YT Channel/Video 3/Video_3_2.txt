"Folk villages are shaped by the unusually high population count. Confined to a fixed footprint by their own palisades and the wilds outside, their constantly growing numbers have to climb upwards. Over time houses can easily reach upwards of ten floors being visible beyond a large distance. These towers support each other with bridges, balconies, ropes used for clothlines and scaffolding. The streets between are overcrowded with the inhabitants, and unfriendly to both Grassfolk and Treefolk. One having to fear being trampled, the other only being able to move with great effort through the narrow spaces. Protected are the villages and towns usually by wooden palisades, reaching dozens of feet in the air to protect even from some Treefolk or similar sized creatures."
