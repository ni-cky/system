"Folk live as varied a life as any other. There are great artisans between them, but usually they exist in a state of mediocratiy and constant effort to fight for their survival. Their cultures tend to be turned inward, shunting the Rest and the Others out of their mind and just deal with themselves first, and their community second. Marrow is often just kept as part of superstitions and traditions, the fewest Folk actively consider what could be, if things were done differently. 
This objective focused mindset allows them to be great travellers though. If they have set their mind to facing what is outside their horizon, usually they will be able to overcome even dire circumstances and bring out the best in themselves."
