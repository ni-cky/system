- I was right in not giving healing abilities
	- Self Harden Bones overpowered
		- 45->67
- 10 is very very doable as a group of 3
- Feedback:
	- Stablize possibly restrictive with Poise tie in?
	- Out of Combat harden bones issue
	- Fun~
	- Action Points flexibility
		- Reactions vs big actions
	- Only Crossbow is restrictive
	- Hot shot is cool and effective
	- Peaks are great
		- Lows are low
		- generally higher hype level than D&D
	- Nat 20s is cool
	- Changing of initative order is interesting
Ability Suggestions:
- Bone Wings
- Detonating
