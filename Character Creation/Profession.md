Having a profession [[Skilled|skilled]] is what your charakter has been doing their whole life. This can be normal jobs like carpenter or baker, or general descriptions of ways to make a living like thief, dungeon delver or acrobat.

Whenever you participate in a [[Skill Challenges|skill challenge]] you may call upon your experiences and use your profession dice pool for the challenge, instead of using the base attribute dice pool determined by the DM.
