Luck is an 8th base stat that is different than the others. It is tracked seperately and can't be modified at character creation, besides via feats.

When rolling any skill check or attack roll you can spend one point of your Luck to turn one failed d20 into a success.

It is also possible to use Luck like a normal base stat.

You are (generally) not able to easily regain Luck.
