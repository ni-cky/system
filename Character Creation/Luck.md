Luck is an 8th base stat that is different than the others. It is tracked seperately and can't be modified at character creation, besides via feats.

When rolling any skill check or attack roll you can spend one point of your Luck to turn one failed d20 into a success.

It is also possible to use Luck like a normal base stat.

You are (generally) not able to easily regain Luck.

"Luck rolls may be called for by the Keeper when circumstances external to an investigator are in question, and also when determining the fickle hand of fate. If, for example, an investigator wants to know if there is an item lying nearby that they could use as weapon, or if the flashlight they have found has any juice left in it, then call for a Luck roll. Note that if a skill or characteristic is more appropriate to a situation, then it should be used rather than Luck."
