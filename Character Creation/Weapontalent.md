### Appearance over Rules
You may and should use weapons in ways not covered by a simple attack challenge. If doing so, the game master should consider the chances for success based on the individual weapon your character is described to wield. The names in this table are purely to convey a certain first impression.

_Sarah, The Folk chef, wields a Great Club that is a huge wooden spoon. While fighting near a pit of acid, she has the idea to scoop up some acid and fling it at the enemy. The challenge should not be more difficult due to her using a Great Club according to the rules._

**Heavy:** You are only able to carry a single heavy weapon/object.

**Marrow:** When this weapon breaks, a Marrow Wraith (see Chapter 7?) appears and hunts you down or the person who broke the weapon.

**Momentum:** The AP costs of any Attack Action made with this weapon is reduced by the number of attacks previously made this round using the same weapon (to a minimum of 1 AP).

**Ranged (X):** With this weapon you can attack any target inside the range of X Steps.

**Recoil (X):** When you take an Attack Action you are Off Balance (X).

**Tripping:** Targets hit with this weapon are Tripped.

**Two Handed (+X):** Using this weapon with only one hand is at disadvantage (+X).

**Weirding:** Targets hit with this weapon are Weirded.

**Wounding (X):** A successful Attack Challenge always converts one success to hit point damage. The remaining successes are regular damage.


Problem: Crossbows/Guns Base Stat
- Force not
- Body as body control and concentration
- Speed falls away, as that would imply a very *unsteady* aim and just whipping around
	- Mel: Speed could read as Reaction time being very precise in a very short time tho
- Intelligence not yea
- Feel as an intuitive understanding of your surroundings
- Experience as experience with the weapon
- Impression ~~cause you can look cool~~ not really
- So imo: Body, (Speed), Feel or Experience (edited)
	- Mel: 1You let the player choose, if they give good arguments for it
