- Heavy: You are only able to carry a single heavy weapon.

Problem: Crossbows/Guns Base Stat
- Force not
- Body as body control and concentration
- Speed falls away, as that would imply a very *unsteady* aim and just whipping around
	- Mel: Speed could read as Reaction time being very precise in a very short time tho
- Intelligence not yea
- Feel as an intuitive understanding of your surroundings
- Experience as experience with the weapon
- Impression ~~cause you can look cool~~ not really
- So imo: Body, (Speed), Feel or Experience (edited)
	- Mel: 1You let the player choose, if they give good arguments for it
