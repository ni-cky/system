**To hit**

-   Roll a number of d20
		-   Determined by the attack type, weapon/ability, magical effects in play and help by others

-   The armor of the enemy determines how many successes are needed to deal damage
-   A success is a dice roll that meets or succeeds 15. If you are skilled in the weapon you wield the DC to beat is 10 instead.

**Damage**
-   Every succesful attack reduces the enemies armor by one
-   All d20 that were not needed to make the attack hit are rerolled and reduce the enemies health
