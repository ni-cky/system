**Taking reactive actions**

-   While you still have unused actions (so always before your turn in the current round) you are able to react to other actions being taken
	- In one instance of reactive actions being taken, you can only take a single reactive action
		- So you can't react to yourself reacting and can't react to two different actions within one reaction chain
-   By someone you:
		-   See?
		-   Are in range of?
		- Are aware of the 

-   As they anounce their action, before them actually executing their action, you can react and anounce an action of your own.
		-   You can react to other reactive actions too
		-   Reactive actions are taken in order of type of reactive action first, reach second and the current initative order third
				-   So: A runs, B sees A and reacts with a hit, C sees A and reacts with a speed boost, D sees B and casts a shielding effect to protect A
						- The current initative is A D B C
						-  Order of reactive actions: D > (preventive) B > (preventive) A > (actual action)& C > (supportive)
-   Types of reactive actions:
		-   Preventive reactive actions: takes place before the action reacted to takes place
		-   Supportive reactive actions: takes place alongside the action reacted to
		-   (typical) reactive actions: takes place after the action reacted to took place
