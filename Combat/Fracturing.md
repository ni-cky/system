If something reduces you to 0 hp, you are able to return with X hp and instantly gain AP equal to the successes of the strike that brought you down.

Fracturing is a task that needs great concentration, takes a reactive action to your death (so you may not do it while already part of the chain) and is thusly voluntary.

- Bosses may use all of these AP instantly to reposition/set up, but never to deal damage
