Heal upon rest to bloodied
To heal completely, during rest at least 1 player needs to tell a tale about an important npc, place or event of their backstory
- Extra benefits for multiple people adding onto each other with own tales?

Problems:
- Encourage players to "Potion store" backstory
- Reward for having nothing left to tell

Alternative Way (both included/possible in teh game!):
- 1d20 Healing per day of rest
