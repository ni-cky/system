Attack of opportunity: (Preventive Action)\[Costs AP according to the weapon used]
-   You attack the target once before they take a move action.
Parry: (Preventive Action) \[Costs AP according to the weapon used]
* You give up all sense of positioning and parry the incoming attack action of an attacker. Make an attack with a melee weapon you are holding. The attack is at disadvantage by the size of the inital attacks dice pool. Each success cancels out one success of the inital attack.
	* If the inital attack has no successes left, treat your own attack as dealing damage as usual.
	* If the inital attack has successes left, the attack is treated as if you do not have armor points and deals damage to hit points.
Just Don't: (Preventive Action) \[4AP]
- You decrease the successes of an incoming attack by one for every success in an (Impression - Convince) skill challenge by yourself.
