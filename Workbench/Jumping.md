1. Needs to be second movement action this round by you, you can jump any fraction of that movement action
    Any doubling/tripling of movement would be just that. If you jump, you can "move" X-times the distance of the normal action
    Jumping obv always straight line

Jumping without a running start cannot exceed 1 step.
