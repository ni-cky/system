Design Target: Fast
- Multiple instances per reaction chain
# These:
- Combat
	- Rounds: equal to player count
	- "Bloodied" means a Talebone gets fractured
	- "Bloodied" should be reached 1 round before combat end
	- "Staggered" means no "party poise" left (enough damage to theoretically remove all poise in game once)
	- "Staggered" should be reached after half of combat
- Poise does not dramatically change over level progression
- Damage increases
- Phases are primarily "easy" vs "hard" fight metric
