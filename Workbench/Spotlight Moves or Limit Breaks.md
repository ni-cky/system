Counter on character sheet beyond the 4 (HP, P, Luck, AP) not great
Over a "status effect"
- So tickable box if
	- Staggered during combat?
	- Killed during combat?
	- Fractured talebone?
		- No, as that should not be tied even more into advantages
- If tickable box ticked -> Can use move

Notes:
- Action that can be used 1/combat
- Should be able to be "saved up" to be used earlier in combat
- Should be able to be "saved up" to make it relevant in short combats as well
	- As otherwise short combats would not make use of this mechanic at all
- 3 types of actions:
> - Fast: Usually Buff and Debuff Effects
> - Medium: Often AoE Damage effects coupled with Movment or rearangment options
> - Slow: Very Complex and grandiouse abilities working with AoEs and dealing Damage


Option 1:
- Status Effect: "Charged"
	- 4 levels
- You can use your action if all 3 levels are activated
> 1A: Gain a level if you end your round without any AP remaining
> 1B: Gain a level if you take damage to hit points

Option 2:
- Counter
- You can spend points from the counter to use your action
> 2A: Increase Counter when a new round starts
> 2B: Increase Counter if you defeat an enemy

Team Increases:
> - Gain level/Increase Counter if another character uses their action
> - Gain level/Increase Counter if a combat is finished
> - Gain level/Increase Counter if a scene is finished?

e.g.
Get over 'ere (6 AP)
Move up to a target of your choice and attack.

Living Bones (4 AP)
> Buffs an ally to achieve greater things
An ally of your choice can take the Dash action without expending Action Points and gains Poise points equal to your level. This lasts until the end of the next round.

> Summons a Marrow Wraith
Summons a Marrow Wraith until the end of this round.

Strike the Earth (5 AP)
> Powerful attacks against the ground, causing tremors

Rally (3 AP)
> Steady allies poise and turn the tide of combat
All allies perceiving you gain poise equal to your level.

Execute (4 AP)
> "One hits" an enemy that is prone
