Counter on character sheet beyond the 4 (HP, P, Luck, AP) not great
Over a "status effect"
- So tickable box if
	- Staggered during combat?
	- Killed during combat?
	- Fractured talebone?
		- No, as that should not be tied even more into advantages
- If tickable box ticked -> Can use move

Notes:
- Action that can be used 1/combat
- Should be able to be "saved up" to be used earlier in combat
- Should be able to be "saved up" to make it relevant in short combats as well
	- As otherwise short combats would not make use of this mechanic at all
- 3 types of actions:
> - Fast: Usually Buff and Debuff Effects
> - Medium: Often AoE Damage effects coupled with Movment or rearangment options
> - Slow: Very Complex and grandiouse abilities working with AoEs and dealing Damage


Option 1:
- Status Effect: "Charged"
	- 4 levels
- You can use your action if all 3 levels are activated
> 1A: Gain a level if you end your round without any AP remaining

Option 2:
- Counter
- You can spend points from the counter to use your action
> 2A: Increase Counter when a new round starts
> 2B: Increase Counter if you defeat an enemy

Team Increases:
> - Gain level/Increase Counter if another character uses their action
