Component: Subsection of vehicle, for one purpose. Has a number of passangers it can carry, a Stability, Command Point(s), and a Function.
Stability: Needs to take X damage or more, to take significant damage. If taking significant damage, roll on the disaster table. Component is not able to use its Function after.
Command Point: One (or more) points marked within a component. A character has to stand here to be able to use the Function of the Component.
Function: Function the component can use. Has an AP cost to use
Size: Switching Components costs at least [Movement Action]

# Example: Glider
Passengers: 2
Size: Dash
Attributes:
- Heading: Where the Glider is pointing on the Hex Grid
- Speed: How many Steps the Glider travels as part of the Encounter
- Height: How far the glider is from the Ground
Nose:
- Stability: 5
- Function (5 AP): Slow down or speed up the Glider by a number of Steps up to a Body Challenge.
Left Wing:
- Stability: 3
- Function (4 AP): During the next move, the Glider can turn left.
Right Wing:
- Stability: 3
- Function (4 AP): During the next move, the Glider can turn right.
Notes:
- If the glider stops moving, a disaster occurs.

Disaster Table:
	1-4: Tumble. The Glider looses 2 Speed.
	5-6: Loose Cargo. Any cargo not carried by a passanger falls.
	7-8: Chain Reaction. Loose a Component. Do only resolve the disaster for that component if it is another chain reaction
	9-10: Minor Break. The glider suffers ehavy damage at 2 places. These places are impassible and have to repaired with 3 Successes each, before being passable again.
	11-12: Major Break. The glider suffers ehavy damage at 3 places. These places are impassible and have to repaired with 4 Successes each, before being passable again. 
	13-14: Loop. All characters have to gain a collective 5 successes at disadvantage equal to speed, or one character starts falling.
	15-16: Rise. The glider rises 5 Steps in height.
	17-18: Drop. The glider drops 5 Steps in height. 
	20: Fall. The Glider starts falling, as do any passangers.
	
# Example: Windship
Passengers: 4
Size: Dash
Attributes:
- Heading: Where the Windship is pointing on the Hex Grid
- Speed: How many Steps the Windship travels as part of the Encounter
- Height: How far the Windship is from the Ground
Hull:
- Stability: 7
Flightstone:
- Stability: 3+Total Components (starts at 6)
- Function (6 AP): Rise or drop Steps equal to successes of a Skill Challenge.
Helm:
- Stability: 4

	7-8: Chain Reaction. Loose a Component.
	9-10: Minor Break. The Windship suffers heavy damage at 4 places. These places are impassible and have to repaired with 3 Successes each, before being passable again.
	11-12: Major Break. The Windship suffers ehavy damage at 6 places. These places are impassible and have to repaired with 4 Successes each, before being passable again. 
	13-14: Hull Breach. The Windship starts dropping 3 Steps each round as part of the movement. All passangers take 3 poise damage.
	15-16: Rise. The Windship rises 15 Steps in height. All passangers take 1 poise damage.
	17-18: Drop. The Windship drops 15 Steps in height. All passangers take 1 poise damage.
	20: Crash Rise. The Windship starts falling upwards. All passangers take 8 poise damage.
