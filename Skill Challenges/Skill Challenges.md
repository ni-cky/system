A skill challenge is a dice roll made by a player/players to achieve a goal outside combat (Combat skill challenges have slightly altered rules).

To initiate a skill challenge a player has to declare an intend, a goal they want to achieve. The game master can request a skill challenge if the outcome of the attempt is uncertain. 

Skill challenges should not be used for trivial actions, as they slow down the game flow and can become a hinderance.

The game master determines a base attribute that fits the task and how many successes are necessary to succeed.

The player may replace the dice pool of the base attribute with any other dice pool, they have available and roll that pool instead, taking possible skilled DCs into account.

Before the player leading the skill challenge rolls their dice, other players may declare to support the challenge.

To be able to do this, their characters have to be able to communicate with the character of the leading player by any means, and they have to explain how they bring in a dice pool of their own.

> e.g.: "Player 1 attempts to unlock a door without a fitting key. They are skilled in the profession "Thief", so they are able to replace the base attribute "Dexterity" with it. To support the attempt Player 2 is keeping an eye on the street to spot any possible guards coming by, bringing in their dicepool of "Awareness"."

Every player participating rolls their dice pools and determines the amount of successes. An unskilled dicepool has one success per roll that meets or exceeds 13.
A 20 on a dice counts as two successes.

All successes are added together and if the number of successes is higher than the necessary number determined by the DM the challenge succeeds.

- Situation: No Successes
	- If there are no successes achieved there are two cases:
		- Dice pool of size 1: The action fails completely and thouroughly and cannot be reattempted due to changing circumstances.
		- Dice pool of size >1: The action fails spectactularly and serious consequences transpire from this failure.
